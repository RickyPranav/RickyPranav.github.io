  <p>
    Hi, I’m **Pranav Duraivel** – an acoustics engineer with a deep passion for sound, vibration, and musical systems. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's in Acoustical and Vibration Engineering. My academic and research interests include musical acoustics, physical modelling synthesis, signal processing, and numerical methods for dynamic systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm currently working on projects involving active vibration control and signal analysis of mechanical and musical systems. When I’m not coding or modelling, you’ll likely find me experimenting with audio hardware or exploring classical piano recordings.
  </p>

  <p>
    My long-term goal is to pursue a PhD in computational acoustics and contribute to the advancement of sound synthesis and physical modelling — especially applied to keyboard instruments like the piano.
  </p>
