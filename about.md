  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Pranav Duraivel</strong> – an acoustics engineer with a deep passion for sound, vibration, and musical systems. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's in Acoustical and Vibration Engineering. My research interests lie in musical acoustics, physical modelling synthesis, signal processing, and numerical methods for dynamic systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently working on projects involving active vibration control and signal analysis of mechanical and musical systems. When I’m not coding or modelling, I’m often experimenting with audio hardware or diving into classical piano recordings.
  </p>

  <p>
    My long-term ambition is to pursue a PhD in computational acoustics and contribute to advancing sound synthesis and physical modelling — particularly for keyboard instruments like the piano.
  </p>
